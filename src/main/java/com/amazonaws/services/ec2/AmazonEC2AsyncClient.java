 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that
 * provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to
 * make web-scale computing easier for developers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and
 * configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with
 * complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on
 * Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time
 * required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing
 * you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing
 * requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by
 * allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon
 * EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient
 * applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

     * entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the OpenSSH format). This can be
     * done at boot (e.g., as part of rc.local) allowing for secure access
     * without passwords. Optional user data can be provided in the launch
     * request. All instances that collectively comprise the launch request
     * have access to this data For more information, see Instance Metadata.
